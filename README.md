# CrackCam

CrackCam is a deep-learning-based web application that is capable of detecting Cracks in the surface by processing the image of that surface. Basically, it is the implementation of the crack detection system.

## Algorithms Implemented for machine learning model

**CNN(Convolutional neural network)**

**LSTM(Long short-term memory)**

## Requirements for Web Application

- The following python modules must be installed to run the Application.
  - ```flask```
  - ```TensorFlow```
  - ```Keras```
  - ```OpenCV```


## Instructions
1. Run ``` app.py``` to start the web application.
 ```bash
 python app.py
 ```
2. Open the browser and went to the started server.
3. Now upload the image and see the result.
4.
